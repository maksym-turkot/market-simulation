# Simple Market Lifecycle Simulation and Performance Analysis

Purpose of the project is to help a hypothetical market manager decide how many stalls of each type to have. This is a simulation of a market based on stalls, queues, and event-driven customers. Market is run with different configurations of stalls and their speeds. Total time customers spend shopping, times spent waiting in line, and line sized for each stall are averaged are written in output files. Program uses various data structures to keep and manipulate the data.

## How to run the program

Run 'main()' method in the Experiment class.

## Configuring the program

Configuration files are located in data/config folder. Program output is located in data/output folder. Program performance log is located in data/log folder. Project documentation is located in 'doc' folder.
